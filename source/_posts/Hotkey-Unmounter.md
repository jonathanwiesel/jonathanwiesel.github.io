This Alfred extension is pretty much like the already existent “ejectall” command in Alfred latest versions; however for those shortcut lovers (like me) I’ve made that function “hotkeyable”.

The program basically eject every image or drive mounted in the system, in case some drive is busy and cannot be ejected a Growl notification will be shown.

The only thing you’ll need to do is install the extension and assign a hotkey with no argument to it.

You can download the extension [here](http://cl.ly/2F1G1U1X261I0U1O1U2M).

And if by any chance you read this and don’t have Alfred installed you can go download it
