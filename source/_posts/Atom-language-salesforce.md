[Atom language-salesforce](https://atom.io/packages/language-salesforce):

For the ones who doesn’t know (and for the ones who cares) I’ve been working developing for the Salesforce platform for almost a year now.

Last week Github revealed what could be the next big thing in code editors, Atom editor, is like Sublime Text or Textmate but promises a lot, so I decided to do my part and grabbed a Salesforce syntax Textmate bundle then converted it to work with Atom.

<!-- more -->

I’ll try to add some snippets and autocompletion features very soon ( pull requests are very welcome ;) )

I totally recommend checking out Atom, is in beta right now and it gets a little annoying for the lack of vital functionality that similar products have but it will surely get really good, specially because of the community’s contributions.
