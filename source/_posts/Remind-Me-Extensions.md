The predefined format of the request is:

```

For date field you can use:

```
today
tomorrow
next week
8/24 -- no year
August 24 -- in that order (month day) and with no year!
```

For hour field you must do it like this:

```
5:00am
2:22pm
1:00 -- will set to 1:00am
14:00 -- will set to 2:00pm
00:30 -- will set to 12:30am, don't use 24th hour, use 00
```

**NOTE:** If you enter an invalid hour the reminder will be setted to 12:00am

Some tips creating reminders:

## Case 1: Just the reminder

```
rm This is my first reminder
```

*A reminder will be created with due date today in 1 hour*

**NOTE:** If the 1 hour later is a new day, the reminder will be created with today’s date, so your reminder will be outdated. Sorry for that.


## Case 2: Reminder and day

```
rm Remember the milk, tomorrow
```

*The reminder will be created with due date tomorrow but the absense of hour will cause to make it 1 hour later than current hour*

**NOTE:** If the 1 hour later is a new day, the reminder will be created with today’s date, so your reminder will be outdated. Sorry for that.

## Case 3: Full reminder with date and hour

```
rm Remember to pick up the dog, 9/12, 4:00pm
```

*The reminder will be created with due date September 12 at 4:00pm*

```
rm Dress like santa, December 24, 23:00
```

*The reminder will be created with due date December 24 at 11:00pm*

## Case 4: Simple reminder with no due date

```
rm Remember to pick up the dog, none
```

*The “none” parameter will make the reminder dateless*

*You need to get a [Powerpack Alfred License](http://www.alfredapp.com/) to install extensions
