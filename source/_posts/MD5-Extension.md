Obtain the MD5 hash of the Finder selected file.

<!-- more -->

To install just [<span class="s1">download</span>](https://github.com/downloads/jonathanwiesel/Enforcer-Projects-/MD5.alfredextension) and doble click the _.alfredextension_ file.*

To run just select in Finder the file you wish to hash then open Alfred bar and type “_md5”_

A growl sticky note will appear with the corresponding MD5 hash.
 Also is sent to your clipboard.

*You need to get a [<span class="s1">Powerpack Alfred License</span>](http://www.alfredapp.com/) to install extensions.

**_Update:_** Now can pass an argument if you want a quick MD5 of some text. To use just type _“md5 theText”_
