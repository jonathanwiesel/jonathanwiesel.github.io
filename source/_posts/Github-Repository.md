It seems Alfredapp guys are taking too much time to develop the submit extensions module they were promising and my extensions are starting to feel lonely in my computer so I uploaded them to a [github repository](https://github.com/jonathanwiesel/Enforcer-Projects-). Some are not documented or may not work for you ( because of a “sudo” password avoidance workaround I configured in my computer ), but I can do my best to do it more functional to everyone if requested.
