I’m a computer science engineering student, I love technology and videogames, and my girlfriend more than anything ^^

I won’t talk much about myself, I live in Venezuela, the capital of crime and insecurity, so I’ll try to keep a low profile.

Over here I’ll publish some of my work from now on, I hope some find it useful.

PS: English is not my primary language so don’t be hard on me ;)
