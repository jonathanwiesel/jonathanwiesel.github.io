Load/Unload specified daemon.

This extension is great for people like me that need some services daemon-dependent to run just in special occasions and don’t want a daemon running always in the background.

To install just download and doble click the .alfredextension file. Then you MUST specify the path to the daemon in the “daemon” variable

***Note that your password is needed because in order to load or unload daemons sudo permissions are required***

***You need to get a [Powerpack Alfred License](http://www.alfredapp.com/) to install extensions**
