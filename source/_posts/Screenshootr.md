A better way to take screenshots.
Because Command-Shift-3 is too long ;)

To install just [download](https://github.com/downloads/jonathanwiesel/Enforcer-Projects-/Screenshootr.alfredextension) and doble click the .alfredextension file.*

To take full screenshot type “ss s” in Alfred bar.

To take screenshot of selected window or draw selection just type “ss” in Alfred bar and then make your selection.

The screenshots will be saved on your desktop.

*You need to get a [Powerpack Alfred License](http://www.alfredapp.com/) to install extensions
