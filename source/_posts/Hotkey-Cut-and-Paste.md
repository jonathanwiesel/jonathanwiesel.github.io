For those of us who need that cut and paste feature back, I found an awesome Applescript by MacTipper that can make that magic happen again with Alfred’s help.

After installing the extension the only thing you need to do is create a hotkey for this extension, I assigned the standard Command-X.

After that the only thing you’ll need to do is select your desired file(s) and/or directories and press your hotkey, you will notice that there’s no shady effect or anything but when you press your hotkey again in the desired destination you’ll find that your selection was actually moved.

You can download the extension [here](http://cl.ly/031I1c2v1e3c1x3T2K2E).

Thanks a lot to [MacTipper](http://www.mactipper.com/) for the code, I hope some find the extension useful.

Go buy the Alfred Powerpack, totally worth it. http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/
