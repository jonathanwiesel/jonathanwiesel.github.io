Open selected file with Sublime Text 2.

<!-- more -->

To install just [<span class="s1">download</span>](https://github.com/downloads/jonathanwiesel/Enforcer-Projects-/Sublime%20Opener.alfredextension) and doble click the _.alfredextension_ file.*

To use just select in Finder the file you want to open, then launch Alfred bar and type _“subop”_.

You can also assign this extension to a hotkey and just select the file then press the hotkey to open in Sublime Text (I prefer this)

*You need to get a [<span class="s1">Powerpack Alfred License</span>](http://www.alfredapp.com/) to install extensions
