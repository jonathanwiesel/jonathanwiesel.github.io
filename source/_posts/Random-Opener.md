This is my first Alfred extension, if you are a Mac user and don’t have Alfred you should totally go and download it http://www.alfredapp.com . Preferably buy a Powerpack license so you can make the most out of it (including using extensions).

Random Opener extension allow you to open a random file on a given directory. To select a directory you only need to specify it on the code variable DIR.

```
# The directory you want to use.
DIR="/Users/jonathanwiesel/Documents"
```

Type ‘random’ in Alfred bar and it will open one random file in that directory, that includes any file in any subdirectory inside it.

You can download it [here](https://github.com/downloads/jonathanwiesel/Enforcer-Projects-/Random%20Opener.alfredextension).

If some of you prefer the directory to be specified in the Alfred bar as a parameter for the query I can work on that if you request it.

I hope you find good use for it.
